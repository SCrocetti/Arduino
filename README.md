# Arduino Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Arduino** repository! This repository is intended to host various Arduino-based electronics projects and experiments. It will include circuit designs, code, and documentation for each project as they are added.

## 📁 Structure

Each project will have its own folder with the following typical structure:

```
ProjectName/
├── README.md # Description and instructions
├── code/ # Arduino sketches (.ino files)
├── circuit/ # Circuit diagrams (.kicad_sch)
├── simulation/ # Simulations of circuits and systems (.spice, .m)
└── assets/ # Photos, videos, and other media
```
