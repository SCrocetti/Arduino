# 07 - LED matrix and shift register

Welcome to the **07 - LED matrix and shift register* project! 
In this project, we'll develop an Arduino library to control a 8Ã—8 LED matrix using a shift register. The library will support displaying a static image or sweeping through a sequence of images to create animation effects.
