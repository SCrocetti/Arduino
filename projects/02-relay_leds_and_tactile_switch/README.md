# 02-Relay, LEDs, and Tactile Switch

Welcome to the **02-Relay, LEDs, and Tactile Switch** project.  
The goal is to use a **tactile button** to send a signal to the **Arduino**, which will then **toggle a relay**. The relay in turn controls two LEDs that indicate its state.

## ðŸ§° Components Required

- 1 x Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- 1 x Relay module (Tongling JQC-3FF-S-Z)  
- 1 x Breadboard  
- 1 x Green LED  
- 1 x Red LED  
- 2 x 220Î© resistors (for LEDs)  
- 1 x Tactile pushbutton switch  
- 1 x 10kÎ© resistor (pull-down for button)  
- Jumper wires  
- Power supply (5V from Arduino or external)

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Description

The project uses a **relay to control two LEDs**, and a **tactile button** to tell the Arduino when to toggle the relay.

- ðŸ”´ **Red LED**: ON by default, OFF when relay is active  
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green LED**: OFF by default, ON when relay is active  
- ðŸ”˜ **Tactile Button**: Used to toggle the relay

### 1. ðŸ§  Relay Control (Arduino to Relay Module)

The relay is triggered using one of Arduinoâ€™s digital output pins.

- `IN` â†’ Arduino digital pin (e.g., pin 7)  
- `VCC` â†’ Arduino 5V  
- `GND` â†’ Arduino GND  

> When the Arduino sets the pin LOW, the relay activates (assuming active-low logic).

---

### 2. ðŸ‘† Button Input (Tactile Switch to Arduino)

The tactile switch is connected as a digital input with a pull-down resistor.

- One leg of the button â†’ Arduino digital pin (e.g., pin 2)  
- Same leg â†’ 10kÎ© resistor â†’ GND  
- Opposite leg â†’ 5V  

> When pressed, the pin reads HIGH. When released, it reads LOW.

### 3. ðŸ’¡ Load Switching (Relay to LEDs)

The relay switches 5V to either of the LEDs depending on its state.

#### ðŸ”´ Red LED (Normally ON)
- `COM` on relay â†’ 5V  
- `NC` on relay â†’ Anode of red LED  
- Cathode â†’ 220Î© resistor â†’ GND  

> ON when the relay is idle.

#### ðŸŸ¢ Green LED (Activated ON)
- `COM` on relay â†’ 5V  
- `NO` on relay â†’ Anode of green LED  
- Cathode â†’ 220Î© resistor â†’ GND  

> ON only when the relay is activated.
